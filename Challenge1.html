		<h3>HTML blockquote element</h3>
		<p>This is an example of using a block quote element:</p>
		<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockquote_element">The blockquote element is used to indicate the quotation of a large section of text from another source. Using the default HTML styling of most web browsers, it will indent the right and left margins both on the display and in printed form, but this may be overridden by Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).</blockquote>
